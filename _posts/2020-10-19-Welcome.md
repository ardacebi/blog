Hey there, and welcome to my blog. 


I'll be sharing theories, scientific and thoughtful approaches to various subjects, and more. I'm interested in writing in my spare time in the areas I'm interested in, to give people to opportunity to analyze and understand various subjects and look at them from different angles.

Articles have key importance in giving the answers to the people who question and allow questioning to the ones who don't. Previously, I was writing similar articles locally on my computer without sharing with anyone but I decided to share some of my previous works and write new ones here to share with the world.

All of my posts will have a commenting section to allow everyone to write their thoughts, ask questions, and answer others' questions. I also plan to actively respond and help with incoming questions.

I hope you'll enjoy the posts, and welcome again.
